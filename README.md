HW 2 Bootstrap Portfolio 


/*-------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------------*/
Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

-A navbar
-A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)
-eg. On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!
-Responsive images


BONUS
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)


Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

Design Layout using Bootstrap and Bootstrap Grids - use md sizing
1) Basic HTML Page with 
    links to bootstrap styles
    local styles
    any necessary javascript? (hamburger menu?)
    meta viewport tag

2) Add in the sticky header
3) Add in the sticky footer

4) Compare bootstrap page to original Basic Portfolio page and tweak the differences in look i.e. padding, font etc.
    List differences here and correct one by one 

    Header bar bottom padding
    Link on Barbara Fick but going to keep that
    
5) Eliminate any styles and links that are not being used - is there a tool for this?

6) Layer in xs, sm, md, lg column width styles to accomodate padding etc.  
The page is simple and bootstrap collapses and expands the navbar, photo and text 

    Does the navbar collapse
    tab with name
    links - stacked on top of one another
    image
    text beneath image
    footer

    image resizes (img-fluid)
